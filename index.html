                <h1 class="title">About our Project Journey and Team</h1>
                <p>
                    Our team was a united trio, Ali, Ryan, and myself. We set out on an exciting journey to create a tool that would help young people interact with technology in a more meaningful way. Under the guidance of our mentor Doug Barnes, we developed an application that made learning about binary logic gates (AND, OR, XOR) fun and intuitive. Even though we had a tight schedule of four weeks, we managed to deliver the project successfully.
                    <br> However, our vision extended beyond just the core application. We also undertook two more critical tasks:</br>
                    <br> 1. We built a Raspberry Pi interface, equipped with Android 7.11, to run our Binary Gates app. It was a hands-on experience, integrating cutting-edge hardware with our software, further showing our commitment to practical tech education.</br>
                    <br> 2. We designed an informative website to record our project's journey. This site serves as a resource for Doug's future students, helping them understand the tech we used in a straightforward and engaging way.</br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>In addition, we also created a video showcasing our app's journey from concept to reality, adding a visual dimension to our learning resources.</br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team's roles were divided efficiently under the SCRUM model. Doug Barnes served as the Product Owner, overseeing our progress. Sandra Been, our Scrum Master, coordinated our efforts. Ali, Ryan, and I formed the backbone of the project with individual responsibilities. Ali managed the testing, bug detection, and setup of the Raspberry Pi. Ryan contributed by testing for bugs and creating the project website. As the lead programmer, I focused on building the Binary Gates app and offered support to Ali and Ryan when needed.
                    Our Binary Gates app was not just a project but a tool to inspire the younger generation about technology. We aimed to make tech education interactive and fun, encouraging kids and teenagers to delve deeper into the digital world. We believe our project has taken a step forward in creating future tech enthusiasts, innovators, and perhaps even leaders.

                <h1 class="title">Our Technological Toolbox</h2>
                  <p> We utilized a diverse array of cutting-edge tools to successfully execute our project, each playing a crucial role in shaping our final product:</p>
                  <br> Adobe Photoshop CC: This powerful graphic design software played a key role in our ideation process. It was used to sketch out the preliminary designs and create a visual expectation of our final products. This included the user interface for the Binary Gates app and the website's layout.</br>
                  <br> Android Studio: As our primary tool for app development, we used Android Studio to program, compile and debug the Binary Gates app. With its extensive capabilities, we were able to proficiently write our app in Java and Kotlin, optimizing for robust performance and user experience.</br>
                  <br> Sublime Text: When it came to crafting our website, Sublime Text was our go-to tool for writing clean and efficient code. We used it to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a more detailed manner, enhancing the user interface and functionality of our site.</br>
                  <br> DreamWeaver: Though DreamWeaver is often viewed as an older professional tool, we believed in exploring its functionality to gain a broader understanding of web design. We dabbled in its use, benefiting from its ability to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, it served as more of an educational detour rather than our main web development tool.</br>
                  <br> As a contemporary, user-friendly platform, WordPress played a significant role in our project. We leveraged its vast array of pre-designed themes and powerful plugins to enhance the aesthetic and functional aspects of our website. However, while WordPress is a versatile tool, we valued the importance of core web development skills above all. Hence, we used WordPress merely as a supportive tool, with the bulk of our website being carefully handcrafted. I meticulously wrote our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, ensuring our site was tailor-made to meet the specific needs of our project.</br>
                  <br> Raspberry Pi: Raspberry Pi: To emulate the real-world operation of our app, we used Raspberry Pi. This versatile device, running Android 7.11, served as the physical representation of our Binary Gates app, demonstrating its practical application and seamless operation.</br>
                  <br> Burndown Chart: As a crucial project management tool, the Burndown Chart helped us track our progress, manage our time effectively, and ensure that we were meeting our project milestones.</br>
                  <br> Planning Poker: We incorporated Planning Poker into our Sprint planning phase. This tool, based on the principle of consensus-based estimating, fostered an atmosphere of effective communication and collaborative decision-making, steering our team towards our shared project goals.</br>
                </div>
                <div class="contentfurther">
                  <h1 class="title">User Stories</h2>
                  User Stories are a very high-level definition of a requirement, containing just enough information so that the developers can produce a reasonable estimate of the effort to implement it. For this Doug Barnes, our Product owner sat down with us and discussed what requirements he wanted the products to contain in the finished project.
                  <br> The basic format of a user story is written down as “As… I want… because…”.
                  <br>
                  <br>We set hours on each task in the user story. This allowed us to time manage the entire project as it is efficient for other members to know how long is needed and what level of priority and difficulty certain tasks are. The information based on the hours needed to complete can be used in a burndown chart to estimate whether or not projects will be completed on time.
                  <br>
                  <br>We time managed it so that all the programming elements for the App such as planning, development and testing were heavily prioritised as the Raspberry Pi and Website depended on it. We set 3-4 hours for certain tasks on average with exception to the Binary Gates App development and Doug’s video for the entire project. Each of these received 5-6 hours on average as they were highly prioritised.
